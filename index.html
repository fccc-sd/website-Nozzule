                    <h3>A bit about me.</h3>

                        <p>I come from Bryan High School, this is my first time taking a programming class in any capacity.
                            I do Robotics through 4-H during the summer, which is where most of my experience with coding and programming comes from.
                            In my robotics projects, I've noticed that I have made many small and simple mistakes that then take a lot of time to figure out. 
                            I hope that I can get better at troubleshooting and learn how to make more consistant codes in this class.
                            I am proud to say that I have gone to state for my robot,
                            and I got second place in the state this year.
                        </p>

            <h3>Things I enjoy.</h3>

                <p> I enjoy reading in my free time, my favorite book is <em>The Hobbit</em>.
                    I also enjoy drawing a bit, but I personally think I'm not really that good.
                    I like to build models, I'm pretty good at them, but my brother is the real expert.
                    I do play a lot of video games, 
                    which I'm guessing a lot of others probably said the same thing.

            <h3>A list of my pets</h3>

                 <!--I'll put a picture of my dog here.-->
                    <img src="IMG_4400.jpg" alt="A picture of Me, my brother, and our dog" height="302" width="403">

                <ul>
                    <li>Stinker: A cat that my parents owned when I was young,
                    but he was horrible towards me so we gave him to my grandma.
                    </li>                

                    <li>Goldicute: A fish from the fair that I won when I was 5, and it lived for 6 years.</li>

                    <li>Little Bear: My Hamster that I did a 4-H project on, 
                        he was once almost dropped after a friend's sister got spooked.
                        He lived for 3 and a half years.
                    </li>

                    <li>Milo: My current pet, he is a small black dog. 
                        We don't know what breed he is because we picked him up from a family friend, 
                        and they got him from a shelter, which rescued him from a Hurricane.
                        He also shake horribly whenever it rains or there's a storm due to his experiences.
                    He's on the older side, but he is still pretty energetic when everyone get home.
                    He tends to bark a lot when someone enter my house.
                    </li>

                <h3>Things I dislike.</h3>

                <p>I'm usually pretty good with a lot of things, but I do have a couple of things that do bother me.
                    One thing that I don't enjoy is heights, I wouldn't call it a phobia though.
                    Another thing that I dislike is gardening, many people find it relaxing, but I just can't find that comfortable feeling.
                    Finally, the thing that I <strong>Hate</strong> is Sauerkraut, It makes me a feel ill when I eat it.
