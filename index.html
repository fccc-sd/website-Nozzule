                    <h3>A bit about me.</h3>

                        <p>I come from Bryan High school, and this is my first time taking a coding class.
                            I do 4-H during the summer, and that is where I do robotics.
                            I tend to make really simple mistakes while coding my robot, 
                            so I hope that I get better at not missing simple things.
                            I have gone to the state for my robotics a couple times,
                            and I got second place in the state this year.
                        </p>

            <h3>Things I enjoy.</h3>

                <p> I enjoy reading in my free time, my favorite book is <em>The Hobbit</em>.
                    I also enjoy drawing a bit, but I'm not very good.
                    I like to build models, I'm pretty good at them, but my brother is better.
                    I do play a lot of video games, 
                    which I think probably isn't very unique since a lot of others probably said the same thing.
                </p>

            <h3>A list of my pets</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stinker: A cat that my parents owned when I was young,
                    but he was horrible towards me so we gave him to my grandma.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Goldicute: A fish from the fair that I won when I was 5, and it lived for 6 years.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li>Little Bear: My Hamster that I did a 4-H project on, 
                        he was once almost dropped after a friend's sister got spooked.
                        He lived for 3 and a half years.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <!--I'll put a picture of my dog here.-->

                    <img src="rat_terrier.jpg" alt="A picture of what breed our dog might be, A rat terrier" height="240" width="320">

                    <li>Milo: My current pet, he is a small black dog. 
                        We don't know what breed he is because we picked him up from a family friend.
                    He's on the older side, but he is still pretty energetic when everyone get home.
                    He tends to bark a lot when someone enter my house.
                    </li>    
                </ul>

                <h3>Things I dislike.</h3>

                <p>I'm usually pretty good with a lot of things, but I do have a couple of things that do bother me.
                    One thing that I don't enjoy is heights, I wouldn't call it a phobia though.
                    Another thing that I dislike is gardening, many people find it relaxing, but I just can't find that comfortable feeling.
                    Finally, the thing that I <strong>Hate</strong> is Sauerkraut, It makes me a feel ill when I eat it.
